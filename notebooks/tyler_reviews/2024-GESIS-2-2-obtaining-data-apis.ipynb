    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through working with the YouTube API to collect data from YouTube channels, including video metadata and comments. You'll gain hands-on experience with the API and learn how to efficiently manage API calls, especially when dealing with rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The YouTube API is well-documented, but it can be a challenging API to start with. I've developed a Python module as part of the course package `icsspy` to make things a little easier. If you are comfortable with the content I present here and want to learn more, I would encourage you to review the code I wrote for the package, which you can find here: [link]().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain and securely store a YouTube API key\n",
    "- Use the YouTube API to collect data about channels and videos\n",
    "- Process and analyze data collected from the YouTube API\n",
    "- Handle API rate limits and errors effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "# The YouTube API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get a YouTube API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is get yourself an API key. You can do that by following these steps, each described in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into / sign up for a Google Account\n",
    "2. Go to the Google Cloud Console website\n",
    "3. Create a new project\n",
    "4. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**\n",
    "5. Create an API key for the YouTube Data API v3\n",
    "6. Store Your API Key Securely\n",
    "7. Restrict your API key\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** First, you'll need to sign up for a Google account if you don't already have one. **(2)** Next, open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) webpage. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/google-cloud-console.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)** Use the dropdown menu to the right of **Google Cloud** to create a **New Project**. If you already have a project setup, it may show the name of the current project. In my case, it shows `INTRO-CSS`. Give your project an informative name and leave the location field as is. Press **Create**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/new-project.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4)** Next, you'll need to enable the YouTube Data API v3. Under \"Quick Access\", click on **APIs & Services** and select **Library**. Type **YouTube** into the search bar and then select **YouTube Data API v3**. A new page will load with \"1 result\". Click the button and then enable the YouTube API on the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/enable_api.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(5)** Now you can create an API key for the YouTube Data API v3. Select **Credentials** from the left-side navigation pane. When the page loads, click the **Create Credentials** button and select **API Key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/create_credentials.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a popup that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/api_key.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(6)** Your API key is like a password; you should treat it as such. Copy your key, store it someplace secure,^[I recommend using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) or another password manager.], and then close the popup. You should see your new key listed under **API Keys** with an orange alert icon to the right of your key name. In my case, the newly created key is `API key 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/listed_keys.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(7)** Finally, you'll want to restrict your API Key. Click the three dots under `Actions` to `Edit API Key`. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/edit_keys.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under `API Restrictions`, select `Restrict key` and then select `YouTube Data API v3` from the drop-down menu. Click `Save`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/restrict_key.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API key is now ready to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Your API Key Securely\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways you can securely use your API key. The approach we'll use here is to store your key(s) in a special file that we can load whenever we need to authenticate with YouTube. From the command line, create a new file called `.env` in the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "cd computational-social-science\n",
    "touch .env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit this file using your preferred text editor. Each line of the file should contain the name and the value of your API key (so just 1 line if you are using 1 API key). The name itself doesn't matter, but it's useful to give it a name that corresponds to the name of the project you created to get the API key. The example below is a randomly-generated fake API key assigned to the name GESIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GESIS='GEzaLyB69Xh5yz3QRsdP-X8QeLMpgWuva-XmWKh'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more than one API key (which can come in handy), make sure each key is on its own line.^[If your code is under version control, make sure you don't commit the .env file to any public repositories. If you're using git, add .env to your .gitignore file.]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your API keys setup, load the packages we'll use in this tutorial. Most of the heavy listing will be done by the YouTube module of the course package, `icsspy`."

    "### Understanding the YouTubeAPI Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The YouTubeAPI class is designed to handle interactions with the YouTube API, specifically error handling and the task of using multiple API keys at once and an exponential back-off strategy to avoid rate limiting and handle errors automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the code block above, we initialize the YouTubeAPI class with a list of API keys. If you use the load_api_key_list() function and a config file, this is a simple process. Once you initialize it, the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creates a \"service\" object**, which is the main interface to the YouTube API and allows us to send requests and receive responses. It does this using the googleapiclient.discovery.build() function and the build_service() method.\n",
    "- **Automatically switches API keys** if one API key hits a rate limit.\n",
    "- **Executes requests** using an execute_request() method. This method handles the actual sending of requests to the API and includes error handling to manage rate limits and retries. It also uses an exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the API with too many requests in a short time.\n",

    "### Get the YouTube Channel ID\n",

    "To collect data from a YouTube channel, we need to get its YouTube channel ID. We can do this using the get_channel_id() function from the icsspy course package. This function is robust in handling different ways users might identify YouTube channels, making it easier to work with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_channel_id() tries two methods to find the channel's ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Custom URL Search: It first checks if the provided channel argument is a custom URL. Many YouTube channels use custom URLs for easier access.\n",
    "2. Username Search: If the custom URL search fails, it then tries to get the channel ID using the YouTube username.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both methods fail, the function returns None."
