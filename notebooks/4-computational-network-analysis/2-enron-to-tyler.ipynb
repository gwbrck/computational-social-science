While we can extend the distributions available in `graph-tool` by applying transformations,^[For example, we could approximate the Negative Binomial distribution by using the Poisson distribution with a Gamma-distributed rate parameter. One way to do this would be to sample a rate parameter $\\lambda$ from a Gamma distribution for each edge, use that parameter to sample the edge weight from the Poisson distribution, and then fit the SBM using the Poisson-distributed edge weights.] we'll keep things relatively simple here by modelling the edges with a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution).

    "### Model 3: Weighted, Poisson-distributed, Refined\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we are modelling our edges as Poisson-distributed. The difference between Models 2 and 3 is that Model 3 includes some additional **r**efinements on the partition we found with Model 2. Let's take a moment to understand what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Refine Nested SBMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recorded lecture I explained that minimizing a model's description length is equivalent to maximizing it's posterior probability. In theory, when we find a good partition with minimimal description length, we've also found the partition with maximum posterior probability. But this isn't always the case, as our search space -- the posterior distribution of all possible partitions -- is vast and complex. It's possible that the partition we find with `minimize_nested_blockmodel_dl()` came from a local minima rather than the global minima. If it came from a local minima, it may be very good but not the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve out estimates, we'll further explore the posterior distribution, enough to escape any local minima and to find the global minima. This involves making iterative refinements using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We sample from our posterior distribution to find partitions that further lower MDL and maximize posterior probability. This process *starts* with our initial partition, rather than randomly, which makes the MCMC sampling process in `graph-tool` very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you can think of the initial partition returned from the `minimize_nested_blockmodel_dl()` function as the best guess about the best partition, and the refined estimate as the best partition,^[Well, unless you count the partition in the next model as a single partition, in which case this would probably be the second best guess!] identified by more thoroughly exploring the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this in `graph-tool`? In short, we want to run a merge-split MCMC refinement algorithm multiple times, each time storing the resulting blockstates and description lengths. At the end, we select the model with the shortest description length. Let's fit Model 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this model is a refinement of Model 2, we use Model 2 as a base and accept new partitions only if they have shorter description lengths than the Model 2 partition."

    "That code block will take a while to run. As you wait for it to finish, let's unpack the code a bit. Above, we set three variables that have a massive impact on how extensively we search the posterior distribution: `num_refinements`, `num_mcmc_calls`, and `num_mcmc_iters_per_call`. Let's break down what each of these are, and how they work together to influence our search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first parameter, `num_refinements`, represents the number of separate searches of the posterior distribution we will conduct. Each starts from the same initial state -- Model 2! -- but is independent from the other searches. By performing a number of independent searches, in this case {{ num_refinements }}, we make it much less likely that our final result comes from a local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, `num_mcmc_calls`, determines the number of times we call the `multiflip_mcmc_sweep()` function within a single refinement loop. If we set to `10_000`, each refinement loop will execute `multiflip_mcmc_sweep()` 10,000 times, and hence will explore more of the parameter space. Once again, this increases the chances of finding improvements for our partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `num_mcmc_iters_per_call` determines the number of iterations that `multiflip_mcmc_sweep()` performs in each individual call. Each iteration attempts to refine the current partition by proposing changes to the MCMC algorithm, and then either accepting or rejecting the change. When we increase this number, we again search the posterior distribution more thoroughly, increasing the chances of improving our partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "How thoroughly we search the posterior distribution depends on all three of these parameters. In this case, we are performing {{ num_refinements }} independent refinement loops, each with {{ num_mcmc_calls }} `multiflip_mcmc_sweep()` calls, each of which performs {{ num_mcmc_iters_per_call }} iterations. This results in a total of {{ num_mcmc_calls * num_mcmc_iters_per_call }} per refinement loop, or {{ num_refinements * num_mcmc_calls * num_mcmc_iters_per_call }} overall.\n",

This quantifies uncertainties in the blockmodelling process, including determining the number of blocks at each level, and block membership at each level (i.e. the block assignment marginal probabilities). Second, we'll perform some additional analyses of the posterior distribution with the goal of figuring out whether it contains other high-probability partitions that could represent plausible competing explanations, or \"data stories,\" for the network structure we've observed.\n",

We can improve our analysis even further by **averaging over many posterior partitions**, weighted by their posterior probabilities, rather than attempting to find the single best fitting partition. This quantifies uncertainty in our node-level block assignments and accounts for variability across many different but plausible partitions.

    "To determine whether this is the case, we can infer the modes of the posterior distribution to identify clusters of graph partitions that are similar to one another but different from those in other clusters (see [Peixoto (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.021003)). This is what we do in the code block below.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code finishes running, it will list each mode in the posterior along with the collective posterior probability of the partitions in each mode. The number of modes detected will depend on the posterior distribution for any given network, but of course the probabilities of all the modes combined will sum to 1. We will also create a series of plots, one for each mode in the posterior, that plots the marginal node block assignment probabilities by drawing the nodes as small pie charts, just like we did above. If there are multiple modes, this will help us compare the different stories or explanation that each partition tells."
