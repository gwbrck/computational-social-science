## Setup

Since we aren't using `graph-tool` in this module, we can go back to using our Poetry environment. Activate it:

```zsh
poetry shell
```

## Imports

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx

import ndlib.models.ModelConfig as mc
import ndlib.models.epidemics as ep
from ndlib.utils import multi_runs
```

## Load Simulated Network

```{python}
sel = pd.read_csv('output/simulated_network.csv')
sel.columns = ['i', 'j']

swel = sel.groupby(['i', 'j']).size().reset_index(name='count')
swel.sort_values('count', ascending=False, inplace=True)
swel.head()
```
