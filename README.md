Hi! This repository contains a Python package and course materials for my [GESIS Fall Seminar](https://www.gesis.org/en/gesis-training/what-we-offer/fall-seminar-in-computational-social-science) course **Introduction to Computational Social Science with Python**. This course is taught in parallel with Dr. [Johannes Gruber](https://www.johannesbgruber.eu), who is teaching a similar [introductory course in R](https://github.com/JBGruber/computational-social-science-r/tree/main). You'll find the course overview and details below, along with details instructions on how to setup your computing environment.

# Course Description

The Digital Revolution has produced unprecedented amounts of data that are relevant for researchers in the social sciences, from online surveys to social media user data, travel and access data, and digital or digitized text data. How can these masses of raw data be turned into understanding, insight, and knowledge? The goal of this course is to introduce you to Computational Social Science with Python, a powerful programming language that offers a wide variety of tools, used by journalists, data scientists and researchers alike. Unlike many introductions to programming, e.g., in computer science, the focus of this course is on how to explore, obtain, wrangle, visualize, model, and communicate data to address challenges in social science. The course emphasizes the theoretical and ethical aspects of CSS while covering topics such as web scraping (obtaining data from the internet), data cleaning and visualization, computational text analysis, machine learning, network analysis, and agent-based modeling. The course will be held as a blended learning workshop with video lectures focused on theoretical background and demonstrations accompanied by live sessions where students can ask questions and work through projects together.

> **Working knowledge of Python is an asset, but is not required.** There is an optional "Introduction to Python" module that you should review before beginning this course.

# Access the Course Materials (GitHub CodeSpaces)

> **Please consult the detailed [setup guide](setup/setup-guide.md) for more information.** If you run into any problems, I'll help you get them sorted in the live sessions or on the course forums on the Moodle site.

# Required Accounts and Software

You will need a GitHub account to use the course materials in GitHub CodeSpaces. That's all you need, but you may want to download and install VS Code on your machine instead of working with VS Code in your browser. See the [setup guide](setup/setup-guide.md) for detailed instructions.
