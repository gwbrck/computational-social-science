# Developing ABMs with Mesa

## A minumum effective dose of object-oriented programming

- one slide of basic concepts
- this will help you understand what follows, but focus on the high-level logic and it will come to you
- the idea is for you to focus on the code for model analysis and experimentation; just run these models, the code is there to help you understnad hwo they work, may be out of reach for now and that is fine; R users can see this as psuedocode and Johannes will show you how to setup, run, and analyze these models

## Mesa model components

- the model class and methods
- the agent class and methods
- initialization procedures, etc.
- steps, iterations, and batches
