# Diffusion and Complex Contagions

## Damon Centola

- one slide overview, relate to what we have done in lecture to this point
- assitned reading

## Threshold Models

- one slide overview, relate to what we have done in lecture to this point
- use the code I wrote for this already -- package + talk

## Developing and Analyzing Threshold Models

- build on the simple contagion SIR models fit earlier; mostly about changing what happens when agents interact
- see the threshold model I already developed for this course! needs to be polished, I think. but runs.
= load from functions; hide complexity in course packahe
- just a slide for overview; for the model loading nd run, and a couple plots. Quijc.
