# Reduction, Realism, and Model Tradeoffs

- agent cognition and preferences as binary or continuous but one-dimensional
    - multiple opinions; modelling schemas; associative diffusion and learning
- time, space, and especially interaction
    - more realistic social network structures, movements through space and time
- we can't do everything

## Fine-grained vs. Course-grained Models

[[@bruch2015agent; @smaldino2023modeling]]

## Associative Learning and Diffusion

## Improving Simulation of Network Societies

- cite CNS example
- if I do cut this, include the plots I made of co-presence, etc. but don't show all the code

<!-- CUTTING -- OUT OF TIME TO FINISH THIS AND IT'S A LOT ANYWAY; THIS IS MORE ADVANCED -->
