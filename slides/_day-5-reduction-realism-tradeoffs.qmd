# Reduction & Realism

#### Model Tradeoffs

- all models **reduce**, but by how much?
- tension between simple theoretical models on the one hand, and complex rich models on the other.
    - Fine-grained vs. coarse-grained Models [[@bruch2015agent; @smaldino2023modeling]]{.nord-light}
    - empirical data and calibration; Bayesian inference


#### What's hot now?

- more realistic and empirically-calibrated models of:
    - agent cognition, emotion, identity, and decision-making
    - network structure, population dynamics
- more sophisticated modelling of stochastic dynamics
- multiple opinions at once
- external / exogenous factors
