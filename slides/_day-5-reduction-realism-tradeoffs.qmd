# Reduction, Realism, and Model Tradeoffs

- agent cognition and preferences as binary or continuous but one-dimensional
    - multiple opinions; modelling schemas; associative diffusion and learning
- time, space, and especially interaction
    - more realistic social network structures, movements through space and time
- we can't do everything

## Fine-grained vs. Course-grained Models

[[@bruch2015agent; @smaldino2023modeling]]

- examples
    - Improving cognition
        - Associative Learning and Diffusion
        - multiple opinions
    - Improving Simulation of Network Societies
        - better networks
    - this is the state of the art: more realism, networks, cognition
