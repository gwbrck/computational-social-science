I will spend a lot of time explaining how the models are implemented in Python, but for most of you the primary [learning objectives]{.kn-pink} will be to (1) understand these models conceptually as well as (2) set up their inputs and (3) analyze their outputs within a theoretical or applied context.

[If you are in the R course, focus on the logic of the Python code to better understand the models themselves; there is no expectation that you will "learn Python." Johannes will show you how to setup, run, and analyze these models using R.]{.nord-light}
