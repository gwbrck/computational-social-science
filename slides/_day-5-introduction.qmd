![A classic example of network-based simulations where the simulated networks come from a probability distribution conditioned on the edges of an observed network. This approach to simulation results in more realistic networks than using simple random graph models (e.g., ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi).](media/chains.png){width=90% .shadow-img}

Network simulations like this are especially common in research on contagion and diffusion dynamics. **Research questions** often focus on how network structure and processes [(e.g., arguing, shaking hands, having sex, repairing bicycles, whatever)]{.nord-light} affect population-level outcomes [(e.g., proportion of the population with an infection, repaired bicyles, a new opinion about vaccines)]{.nord-light}.

They may also model nodes as [agents]{.kn-pink} who interact with one another in simulated time and space.

### ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–<br>Simulation

<br><br>

Today we'll talk about two generative approaches to simulation-based research, as well as ways to combine them.

- sampling from **probability distributions**
  - the general idea
  - sampling networks from probabilitic models
- developing **agent-based models**
  - including models with probabilistic processes

These kinds of processes on networks, and network dynamics [(how networks evolve)]{.nord-light} more generally, can be difficult or impossible to observe, and running some kinds of experiments would be unethical at best. Simulation is one powerful solution.
