<!-- TITLE SLIDE SPEAKER NOTES
- **John**: Hello and welcome to the GESIS Fall Seminar “Introduction to Computational Social Science”.
- Johannes: I’m Johannes
- **John**: And I’m John
- Johannes: This course has an R and a Python version. But since the topics are essentially the same, - John and I decided to give the lectures in the course together.
-->

### Course Schedule

| Day 6             | Project Work Day and Outlook           |

::: {.notes}
- **John**: This has the advantage that you will hear about obtaining data and text analysis in session 2 and 3 from Johannes, who is an expert in both
- Johannes: And you will hear about network analysis and agent-based Models in sessions 4 and 5 from John who is an expert in these two topics
- **John**: Of course you will see the code demonstrations in the language that you selected.
- Johannes: So I will walk you through the R code for network analysis
- **John**: And I will show you how to do text analysis in Python

## Who is John?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
John McLevey (he / him)<br>
Associate Professor, University of Waterloo<br>
PI, [Computational Social Science Lab]{.kn-pink}<br>
[john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca)

<br>
I first got into computational social science via natural language processing and probabilistic topic modelling as a PhD student ~ 2009.

<br>
Within computational social science, my interests and expertise are primarily in network science, computational text analysis, generative modelling, bayesian data analysis, causal inference, and scientific computing. I also work in cognitive social science, political sociology, sociology of science, and environmental sociology.

::: {.notes}
And I'm an Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario Canada, where I direct the Computational Social Science Research Lab, formerly known as Netlab. I was first introduced to computational social science in 2009, when I was a new PhD student interested in using natural language processing and probabilistic topic modelling in research on social movements and contentious politics.

Since then, my interests in computational social science have evolved to include a wide variety of approaches to computational text analysis, as well as network science, Bayesian data analysis and generative modelling, causal inference, and scientific computing. All of these areas, including several others, are introduced in my book *Computational Social Science*, which was published by Sage in 2022.

Substantively, I work primarily in the areas of cognitive social science, political sociology, sociology of science, and environmental sociology.

<br>
Computational social science is diverse and multi-paradigmatic

::: {.incremental}
- often involves working with "found" / "readymade" data [[@salganik2019bit]]{.nord-footer}
- often employs machine learning frameworks, computational experiments, and/or *generative* models [[@edelmann2020computational; @centola2018behavior; @bail2022breaking; @mcelreath2018statistical; @grimmer2022text; @kitts2023rethinking; @smaldino2023modeling]]{.nord-footer}
- involves difficult interpretative work [[@grigoropoulou2022data; @nelson2020computational]]{.nord-footer}
- generally requires scientific computing and software development skills to develop data processing and modelling *pipelines* [[@cssbook; @mclevey2022doing; @mclevey2021reproducibility]]{.nord-footer}
- should meet a higher bar for privacy protection, research ethics, transparency, and accountability [[@o2017weapons]]{.nord-footer}
- is computational **and** social scientific

But what happens when these systems are trained using biased data? Machine learning algorithms are designed to learn and reproduce patterns in data, but if biased data is used to train these predictive models, the models will reproduce and in some cases amplify those same biases. At best, this renders the predictive models ineffective. At worst, it results in discriminatory policing.\n\n    In this talk, Kristian will elaborate on the concept of \u201cbias in, bias out\u201d in machine learning with a simple, non-technical example.  She will then demonstrate how applying machine learning to police records can result in the over-policing of historically over-policed communities. Using a case study from Oakland, CA, she will show one specific case of how predictive policing not only perpetuates the biases that were previously encoded in the police data, but \u2013 under some circumstances \u2013 actually amplifies those biases.\n\nKristian Lum is the Lead Statistician at HRDAG. Kristian\u2019s research focus has been on furthering the statistical methodology most commonly used by HRDAG\u2014population estimation or multiple systems estimation\u2014with a particular emphasis on Bayesian methods and model averaging.

We could:

- translate to one language,
- filter to one language,
- use multiple single language models, or
- use multi-lingual models.

In this example, I will filter to English language comments.

::::

::: {.notes}
On Day 5, we'll introduce the foundations of agent-based modelling. ABMs have been central to computational social science since the earliest days of the field, in part because they enable us to simulate and intervene in systems and processes that are difficult to observe and intervene in in the real world. Damon Centola's work, for example the book *How Behaviour Spreads*, is a great example of how to use ABMs to do theory-oriented computational experiments on how information, beliefs, and behaviours spread on social networks, and which factors accelerate or slow down diffussion.

We'll learn how to setup the kinds of experiements that Centola runs, as well as similar models that fall under the umbrella of "opinion dynamics;" specifiucally threshold and bounded-confidence models.
