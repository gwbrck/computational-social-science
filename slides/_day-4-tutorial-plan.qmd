First, we set up our environment. We will do things a little differently this time, since `graph-tool` has some dependencies that can be tricky to install on some machines. From the command line:

<br>

```zsh
conda create --name gt -c conda-forge graph-tool
conda activate gt
```

We'll start by working with the

### Political Blogs Network

to see some quick results and learn a few basics of `graph-tool`.

<br><br>

Then we'll work with the

### Enron Email Network

to learn how to iteratively develop, assess, compare, and improve Nested SBMs.

<br><br>

Finally, we'll shift over to working with data from the YouTube API, specifically a

### 'Talks at Google' Entity Co-mention Network

to push your modelling skills a little further.
