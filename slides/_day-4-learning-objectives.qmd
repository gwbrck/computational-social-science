## Learning Objectives

[This is not an introduction to network analysis in general! We will focus on computational approaches to a few important topics.]{.nord-light}

<br>

#### understand pitfalls and problems with heuristic network analysis

游댮 community detection via modularity-maximization^[I am focusing on modularity-based approaches here because (1) modularity-maximization is currently the most common way of identifying subgroups [@moody2023cohesion] and (2) it's a particularly bad approach that we should stop using.] [(Louvain, Leiden)]{.nord-light}<br>
游댮 implicit model-based visualization [(force-directed)]{.nord-light}

<br>

#### understand how a generative approach overcomes these and other problems

游릭 generative modelling and Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA)<br>
游릭 nested Stochastic Blockmodels (SBMs)<br>
游릭 explicit model-based visualization

<br>

#### develop nested SBMs

游릭 fit, refine, assess, interpret, visualize, and compare models
