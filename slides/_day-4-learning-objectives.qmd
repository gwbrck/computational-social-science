## Learning Objectives

We will focus on [generative modelling]{.kn-pink} for network analysis, especially "community detection" and visualization.

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- differentiate heuristic and generative approaches to network analysis in general, and community detection in particular
- explain problems with heuristic approaches to community detection, specifically modularity-maximization
- understand the logic of generative modelling and Bayesian data analysis (BDA) applied to networks
- understand how Bayesian Stochastic Blockmodels offer a flexible, interpretable, and statistically principled approach to analyzing networks
- iteratively fit, refine, assess, compare, visualize, and interpret Nested Stochastic Blockmodels in Python using `graph-tool`
