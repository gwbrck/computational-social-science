# Splitting up the Canadian Hansard by Year

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import glob
import re
```

Path to full data (not in git repo). This needs to be cleaned up more generally, would probably make more sense to re-process all the original csv files by month...

```{python}
canadian_hansard_full = '../canadian_hansard/hansard-speeches-v301.csv'
```


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv(canadian_hansard_full)
```

Group by year and write to seperate files.

```{python}
for year, data in df.groupby('year'):
    output_file = f'../canadian_hansard_{year}.csv'
    data.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    print(f'Created {output_file} with {len(data)} records.')
```
